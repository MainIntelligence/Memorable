# Memorable
A library with types allowing for quick and easy implementation of advanced memory functionalities.

# Memory Management
Memorable lib provides the functionality of standard dynamic memory with a more predictable layout and some added functionality:
  
    -Maybe you want to save a group of things to disk, and be able to load them back into memory.
    
    -Maybe you want to linearize node allocation and deallocation simply and effectively.
    
    -Maybe you just want to be confident that allocations won't fail in the middle of a process.
    
  -Memorable types can take care of that for you! With good consideration for efficiency, understandability, and even binary code size.
